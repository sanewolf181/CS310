A Computational Model of Chemotaxis in E.Coli
Progress Report
Week 9, Term 1

Preamble
========
In this progress report, I will show that the design phase for my project has been concluded,
that all forseeable issues have been overcome, and that my project is on track to be a success.
I will also detail any changes I have made to my specification in order to make my project realisable.

Research Conducted
==================
Because my project concerns a subject area which I am not very familiar with,  I have had to 
do significant research in order to fully comprehend the mechanics behind it, and to make certain that
my project is feasable. Over the course of the previous weeks, I have realised that my project concerns 
not only the detailed mechanical algorithms used by bacteria to move about, but also the mathematical models
of cellular automata, and the physical method of diffusion of a chemical. A more practical concern is
how to implement the algorithms efficiently as well as accurately, as my simulation must run at a reasonable
speed.




Is the project on track?
  - How much of the project has been realised so far?
  - Am I behind schedule?

If not, what will I do to rectify the situation?
  - timetable rescheduling

Changes to specification?
  - are any goals not realisable
  - addition/removal of any objectives?
  - application of new methods

Challenges?
  - what unforseen challenges have come up?
  - how have I dealt with them?

End of Design phase
  - the progress report should show that the project design
    and schedule have been debugged and that the project is on 
    track to be successful


Progress Report should show:
  - all necessary design, research, analysis has been carried out
  - future work is well planned
  - project has been well researched
  - report is consistent with specification
  - unforseen problems have been detected and overcome
  - the design phase has been debugged, and the project is on track to be a success
